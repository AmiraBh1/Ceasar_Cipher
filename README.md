This Python program implements the Caesar cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. Here's what it does:

 ✨𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐩𝐮𝐭: The program prompts the user to select whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message. Then, they enter the text to be processed and the shift value.
 
 ✨ 𝐄𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧/𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the text by a specified number of positions. Non-letter characters remain unchanged.
 
 ✨ 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦 𝐓𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The program continues to run until the user enters "exit."
